- **No modifications**: Do not alter the original project code
- **Follow official docs**: Use installation/launch methods from project documentation
- **Preserve functionality**: Maintain all original features and capabilities
- **Clean installation**: Ensure reproducible setup process
- **Proper isolation**: Use appropriate virtual environments if needed
- **Cross platform**: Try to make the launcher cross platform

## Deliverables
