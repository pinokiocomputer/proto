# BRIA Background Removal v2.0 Model Card

RMBG v2.0 is our new state-of-the-art background removal model, designed to effectively separate foreground from background in a range of
categories and image types. This model has been trained on a carefully selected dataset, which includes:
general stock images, e-commerce, gaming, and advertising content, making it suitable for commercial use cases powering enterprise content creation at scale. 
The accuracy, efficiency, and versatility currently rival leading source-available models. 
It is ideal where content safety, legally licensed datasets, and bias mitigation are paramount. 

Developed by BRIA AI, RMBG v2.0 is available as a source-available model for non-commercial use.
